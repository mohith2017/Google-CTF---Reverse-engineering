# Google-CTF---Reverse-engineering
This repository contains the Android app based reverse engineering task.

The Android app has been reverse engineered through smali code, apktool and then analyzed through gdbconsole in order to obtain the assembly code flow.

Further, the app login functionality was successfully cracked through the binary analysis and then uploaded here.
The login now works without credentials(only when run through cmd with specific register values)
